# Solution

## Assumed Knowledge
The red bridge is an iconic landmark of San Franciso â€” _The Golden Gate Bridge_.

## Steps
1. From the aforementioned deduction, I used Google Maps to determine the photograph's location based on the incoming and outgoing traffic. I determined that it was taken on the northern side of GGB.
2. I channelled my inner-Rainbolt GeoGuessr skills and put my focus towards:
     * Terrain
     * Road Infrastructure
     * Lookout Points
3. Still utilising Google Maps, I used the Street View feature. By browsing through street images, I managed to land at **H.Dana Bowers Rest Area** which had a similar view to the photo.

# Flag
Following the flag's syntax, the flag was DUCTF{H._Dana_Bowers_Rest_Area}
